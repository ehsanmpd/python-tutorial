# Data Structures

## Comparison of data structures
Both ```list``` and ```numpy``` construct arrays.

```numpy``` is faster than ```list```, because it is stored in one continuous place in memory, i.e., locality of reference.
Numpy libraries are in Python, however, for the parts that require fast computation, it uses C/C++.
