# Sort algorithms

## Merge sort
Merge sort is divide-and-conquer algorithm. It has average and worst-case time complexity of ```O(nlog(n))```. 
A Python implementation is available [here](sort-alg.py).

## Built-in sort function
The built-in ```sort()``` function for a ```list``` in python is using Timsort algorithm.
